            <p>The Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun. On average, it is about 93 million miles away from the Sun.</p>
            <p>Earth's orbit obeys Kepler's laws of planetary motion, formulated by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler in the 17th century. Kepler's laws describe the elliptical shape of planetary orbits and how planets move faster when closer to theSun and slower when farther away. </p>
            <p>Earth's orbital period is approximately 365.25 days, known as a sidereal year. However, a tripical year, whihc is based on the saesons and equinoxes, is slightly shorter, about 365.24 days/ To account for this difference, we add an extra day to our calendar every four years in a leap year.</p>
            <p>Earth's orbital speed and distance from the Sun play a crucial role in determining our climate and seasons. The tilt of Earth's axis relative to its orbit results in the changing seasons as our planet orbits the Sun.The varying intensity and duration of sunlight at different latitudes drive weather patterns, temperature variations, and the four distinct seasons: spring, summer, autumn (fall), and winter.</p>
