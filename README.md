3D animation of planets orbiting the Sun

## Tech Stack 
1. HTML
2. JavaScript 
3. Three.js library 

## Technology Breakdown 
  1. `THREE.Scener()` : A constructor provided by the Three.js library that creates a new scene object. 
  A scene is kind of a stage where we place our 3D models, lights, and cameras before rendering them to the screen. 


## Usage 
I used the Three.js JavaScript library to creat a 3D animation of Earth orbiting the Sun. It's an ongoing and evelving project that will eventually offer an interactive way to explore the dynamics of our planet's journey through space.
